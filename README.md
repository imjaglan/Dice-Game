# Dice-Game
I have built a simple game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript ONLY
( not using any framework). The game s use basic concepts of JS, and demonstrate a
decent use of CSS for the UI. Also, the game is easily playable.
Now let’s proceed to learn about the game .


       
                                                       The game

                                      (landing screen with a loading message)
                                      
                                                      IDEA & UI
The game will have a dice, which will be shuffled after intervals of fixed time. The output of the
dice will be shown to the player.

There will be a countdown timer showing the time left before the next shuffle.

The player will have to guess the output before the timer ends. To guess the output, the player
will have to click on any of the 6 options corresponding to 6 faces of the dice. The player has to
make this choice before the timer ends.

When the timer ends, the dice will shuffle. If the output of the dice matches the choice made by
the user, the score will be increased. The player will also be shown a message that their choice
was correct.

If the choice does not match the dice output, the score will remain the same. Again the player
will be shown a message saying their choice was wrong.
