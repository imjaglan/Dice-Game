# Dice-Game
I have built a simple game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript ONLY
( not using any framework). The game s use basic concepts of JS, and demonstrate a
decent use of CSS for the UI. Also, the game is easily playable.
Now let’s proceed to learn about the game .

                                                      IDEA & UI
The game will have a dice, which will be shuffled after intervals of fixed time. The output of the
dice will be shown to the player.

There will be a countdown timer showing the time left before the next shuffle.
